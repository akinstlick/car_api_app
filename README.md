Android app pulling data from the NHTSA data api
## About
This app searches the NHTSA database to find all car models that were made by whichever brand is entered into the search bar. The user is also able to search for a model year, and this will limit the search to only cars made within that year. I used [this](https://rapidapi.com/blog/build-android-app-with-api/) tutorial to help me along the way.
## Running
To run this app, open it in Android Studio and launch it in the emulator. You should be greeted by the main activity screen.
## Usage
First, enter your desired car make into the top search box. Then, if you wish to limit your searches by model year, enter a year in the bottom search box. Then hit the search button and watch as all your desired car models (sorted by name) are populated into the list view.
